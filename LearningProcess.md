# Learning Process
## 1. How to Learn Faster with the Feynman Technique

* Feynman technique is a type of technique to learn concepts in a very simple and effective way.

## 2. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

* I am very much interested in the recall technique. After studying something close the book and recall it.

## 3. What are active and diffused modes of thinking?

Active Mode:

* Active mode is a way of thinking about the problem which is known already.
  
* It focuses on a particular period.
  
Diffused Mode:

* Diffused mode is a way of thinking about a problem that is not known.
  
* It is a relaxed mode, do you think creatively when you have free time?

## 4.  According to the video, what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic? Only mention the points.

* Deconstruct the skill: Split the skill into small parts.
  
* Learn enough to self-correct: If you find any mistake, Try it differently.
  
* Remove practice barriers: Avoid the internet, social media, and any other distractions when you are learning new topics or concepts.
  
* Practice at least 20 hours: If you want to learn a new concept, you spend at least 20 hours time.

## 5. What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?

* Break concepts down into simpler parts.
  
* Practice consistently and apply concepts in projects.
  
* Explain the concept in your own words.
  
* Teach others or discuss with peers.
  
* Use active learning techniques like the Feynman Method or mind mapping.
  
* Set achievable goals with flexible deadlines.
    
* Reflect on your learning and adjust strategies.
